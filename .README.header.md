# ut-registration-api

Optimized interface for UT Austin's registration client written in TypeScript.

> Check out the notes I wrote for myself while reverse engineering this API here: https://gist.github.com/An-GG/9ef0bfb88744a8183ec3d5faf1a39471 

This interface is a one-to-one translation of [all the endpoints I have encountered and documented](https://gist.github.com/An-GG/9ef0bfb88744a8183ec3d5faf1a39471) with minor convenience abstractions.

- **Zero browser overhead:** Registration methods are implemented as pure fetch GET/POST requests and consist of only a single outgoing transaction, so you don't need to wait for the server to respond before you begin making requests. 
- **Parallelize requests:** Stockpile many nonces in advance and use them all at once, even if the server is unresponsive.


## Install

Add to your project:
```sh
$ npm i ut-registration-api
```

## Example

```js
let { RegistrationSession } = require('ut-registration-api')

async function main() {
    
    let session = new RegistrationSession(2023, 'Spring');
    await session.login();

    let ris = await session.getRIS();

    // Single time acknowledgement is required only once for each semester.
    // This is the page that asks you to check the box next to:
    // 'I acknowledge that the courses for which I am registering are consistent with my degree plan.'
    //
    // You need to call this manually at least once each semester, or requests will silently fail.
    await session.singleTimeAcknowledgement();

    await session.addCourse(11111);
}
main();
```
> **NOTE:** Registration methods throw an error when they are unsuccessful. Assume method calls that don't throw completed successfully.

When running the example, `addCourse` throws because `11111` isn't a valid course number.
```
$ node example.js
.../node_modules/ut-registration-api/dist/api.js:390
                throw new Error(r.dom('span.error').parent().text());
Error:         
        Add was unsuccessful because:
                The unique number entered is not a valid number.
                (Code:0095)
...
```

### What is `cookies_from_authenticated_session` ??

~~`RegistrationSession` cannot authenticate you using your EID/password directly because this is non-trivially complicated. Instead, you must provide cookies from an already authenticated session.~~

> **Update:** This package now incorporates `ut-auth-utils`, and can create an authenticated session to fetch cookies on its own. The `login()` method will launch a Chromium window to login with your EID / password graphically. 

Session cookies are saved to `/tmp` by default, so you shouldn't need to login manually every time.


## TypeScript Usage

```ts
import { RegistrationSession } from 'ut-registration-api'

async function main() {
    let session = new RegistrationSession(2023, 'Spring');
    await session.login();

    let ris = await session.getRIS();
    let classes = await session.getClassListing();
}
main();
```
